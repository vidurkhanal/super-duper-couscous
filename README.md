In today's digital age, security is of utmost importance, and managing multiple passwords for various online services can be a daunting task. To address this challenge, we propose to develop an advanced online password manager with password generator functionality and a seamless dark mode toggle based on system preferences. Our system will also incorporate an additional layer of security in the form of a Master PIN, which users must authenticate with before performing any actions that change the password vault.

<b>Key Features</b>:

 - Password Management: The core functionality of the online password manager will allow users to securely store and organize their passwords for different online accounts and services. The system will utilize robust encryption algorithms to safeguard user data, ensuring that their passwords are stored in a highly secure manner.

- Password Generator: The password manager will come equipped with a strong password generator that can generate complex and unique passwords for each account. Users can specify password length and complexity, ensuring their accounts are well-protected against potential security threats.

- Dark Mode Toggle: The user interface of the password manager will feature a dynamic dark mode toggle, which will automatically adjust based on the system preferences of the user's device. This will provide users with a comfortable and visually appealing experience, regardless of their preference for light or dark mode.

- Master PIN Authentication: Security will be paramount in our password manager. To add an extra layer of protection, users will be required to set up a Master PIN during the account creation process. This Master PIN will be used to authenticate any critical actions, such as adding, modifying, or deleting passwords from the vault, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive information.

- Cross-Platform Compatibility: The online password manager will be accessible across multiple platforms, including web browsers, desktop applications, and mobile devices. This cross-platform compatibility will enable users to access their passwords securely from anywhere, at any time.

## Built With

Our online password manager with password generator functionality, dark mode toggle, and Master PIN authentication is developed using a powerful stack of modern technologies to ensure a robust and reliable system. The application is built with the following technologies:

- Next.js: Next.js is a popular React framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) and static websites. It provides a seamless development experience and enables us to create a performant and SEO-friendly frontend for our password manager.

- TypeScript: TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability. By utilizing TypeScript, we can catch potential bugs during development and improve the overall development process.

- Express: Express is a fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js. We leverage Express to build the backend of our password manager, handling API requests, routing, and other server-side functionalities.

- GraphQL: GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need. By implementing GraphQL in our application, we enable efficient and flexible data retrieval for our users, optimizing the performance of the password manager.

These technologies work cohesively to create a secure, efficient, and user-friendly online password manager. Next.js provides a robust frontend framework with TypeScript support, while Express serves as the backend, handling authentication, password storage, and user-related operations. GraphQL ensures optimized data fetching and delivery, further enhancing the overall user experience. With this powerful stack, our password manager is designed to meet the highest standards of security and performance, ensuring a seamless and reliable password management solution for our users.

## Getting Started

The repo ships with both client and server implementations.

### Prerequisites

Since, both client and server are built on Typescript on the Node runtime. So thats the primary requisite.

* node

```sh
brew install node
```

Optionally, I recommend installing node using NVM, so you can securely install multiple versions of node.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vidurkhanal/super-duper-couscous.git
```
2. Install the dependencies from both client and server.

- Server:
```sh
cd server
yarn
```

- Client:
```sh
cd client
yarn
```

3. The server ships with .env.example so you can populate the server with your own Postgres DSN and Redis DSN.

4. Start the Server:
```sh
cd server
yarn start:dev
```

5. Start the nEXT client.
```sh
cd client
yarn dev
```

6. Voila, localhost:3000 should now be serving your very own password vault, encrypted algorithmically.
